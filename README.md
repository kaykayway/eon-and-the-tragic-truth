eon, the tragic truth.
 Why You Should NEVER Use Project Eon — A Full Warning
1. Project Eon markets itself as an “OG Fortnite” experience, aiming to attract players nostalgic for early Fortnite gameplay. However, its facade hides malicious intentions that can compromise your computer and personal accounts. Unlike other OG Fortnite clients, Project Eon inserts itself into your Windows Registry without your consent. This allows it to run automatically every time you start your PC, making it a persistent threat. Such behavior is uncommon for game mods and should immediately raise suspicion.

2. When software writes entries to your Windows Registry under the “Run” keys, it means it will launch silently in the background whenever your computer boots up. Project Eon specifically adds itself there, disguising the entry with an “OG Fortnite” icon to appear harmless. This tactic is a classic malware move to avoid detection by users who check their startup programs. Running without your permission allows Project Eon to carry out hidden tasks without you knowing. This stealthy operation is dangerous and could lead to serious data breaches.

3. The most critical risk posed by Project Eon is its ability to steal your Discord token. A Discord token is a secret key that lets anyone access your Discord account without needing your password or two-factor authentication. Project Eon secretly sends your token to an attacker-controlled server, giving them full control of your Discord identity. Once stolen, attackers can read your private messages, join your servers, and impersonate you to your friends. Losing control of your Discord account can have devastating personal and social consequences.

4. The developer behind Project Eon has a documented history of exploiting Discord users, particularly younger players who are less suspicious. This person uses a Discord bot that automates the process of stealing tokens from anyone who interacts with it. This bot often pretends to offer “free Nitro” or other perks to lure victims. Once someone accepts the offer or simply interacts, the bot silently harvests their Discord tokens. This method has successfully compromised many accounts and has caused widespread damage in Discord communities.

5. This Discord bot linked to Project Eon actively scrapes tokens from users in targeted servers, spreading harm beyond just the program installation. Even if you uninstall Project Eon from your PC, the bot can still steal your token if you remain in servers where it operates. It constantly monitors chats and interactions to capture more tokens and compromise additional users. This means your Discord account is at risk until you leave such servers and revoke suspicious authorized apps. Ignoring this threat can lead to repeated account thefts.

6. Victims of Project Eon often report sudden loss of their Discord accounts after installing the program. Attackers use stolen tokens to lock users out by changing passwords, emails, and recovery options. Once locked out, users rarely regain access to their accounts, losing friends, messages, and valuable community memberships. This permanent damage is why preventing token theft is so important. Losing your account can also expose private conversations and personal data to malicious parties.

7. Besides token theft, Project Eon’s registry entry allows it to reinstall or reactivate itself if you delete its files manually. This persistent mechanism is a hallmark of malware, designed to survive user attempts at removal. Without removing the registry key, the program can silently re-download itself or run hidden scripts on your system. This behavior makes Project Eon extremely difficult to get rid of without technical knowledge. Ignoring registry cleanup means the threat remains active even after uninstalling.

8. To protect your system, it is essential to remove Project Eon’s registry entry immediately if you suspect infection. Open the Windows Registry Editor by pressing Win + R, typing regedit, and hitting Enter. Navigate to the path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run. There, look for an entry named “OG Fortnite” with a Fortnite-style icon. Right-click this entry and select Delete to stop Project Eon from launching on startup.

9. After deleting the registry entry, you must also remove related files from your computer to fully eliminate Project Eon. Check folders like %AppData%, %LocalAppData%, and %Temp% for any suspicious Fortnite or Eon-related files or folders. Deleting these files prevents the program from reinstalling or continuing to run in the background. Running a trusted antivirus or anti-malware scan (such as Malwarebytes or Windows Defender) will help find any hidden malicious files. This step is critical to ensure your system is clean and secure.

10. If your Discord account has already been compromised through Project Eon, quick action is necessary to prevent further damage. Immediately change your Discord password to lock out unauthorized users. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your account to add an extra layer of security. Also, review your Discord authorized apps and remove any that look suspicious or that you don’t recognize. Notify your friends and servers in case they received scam or spam messages sent by the attacker using your account.

11. Reporting the malicious Discord bot connected to Project Eon to Discord’s Trust & Safety team is a crucial step. Discord actively investigates reports and removes harmful bots and servers to protect the community. Providing detailed information helps them track and ban these abusive entities quickly. This collective effort helps prevent others from falling victim to the same scam. You can report bots and servers here: https://dis.gd/report.

12. Many players fall victim to Project Eon because it appeals to nostalgia and trust in “OG Fortnite” experiences. Scammers exploit this emotional connection to trick users into downloading malicious software. Always remember that legitimate clients or mods never hide in the registry or steal tokens. Trustworthy projects are transparent, open source, and don’t modify your system secretly. If a program seems suspicious or asks for excessive permissions, avoid it.

13. There are safer, trusted alternatives to Project Eon that provide similar OG Fortnite gameplay without risks. Examples include projects like Rift, Reboot Royale, and Oasis, which have no history of token stealing or registry tampering. Always research any client or mod before installing, and download only from official or well-known community sources. Join verified Discord communities and forums to verify the legitimacy of projects. Protect yourself by staying informed and cautious.

14. If you or a friend has been tricked into installing Project Eon, do not panic but act quickly. Follow the removal instructions carefully, change Discord passwords, and run antivirus scans. Inform others in your community about the threat so they don’t suffer the same consequences. Sharing knowledge is the best defense against scams that rely on secrecy and surprise. The more people aware of Project Eon’s tactics, the safer everyone will be.

15. Even if you have removed Project Eon, continue to monitor your Discord account activity closely. Watch for unusual messages, login notifications, or unauthorized changes. Attackers sometimes plant backdoors or obtain tokens through other means after the initial infection. Maintaining strong passwords, 2FA, and cautious behavior keeps you protected long-term. Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time fix.

16. Project Eon is a reminder that downloading software from untrusted sources can have severe consequences. The ease of token theft shows how vulnerable users are to seemingly innocent programs. Never share your Discord tokens or passwords with anyone, and never enter them into unknown apps. Always check for reviews, community feedback, and safety before downloading. Cybersecurity starts with awareness and cautious decisions.

17. Remember, legitimate developers respect your privacy and security. They provide clear instructions, source code, and do not hide malicious functionality. Project Eon’s shady behavior is a betrayal of trust that harms the entire community. Choosing safer, verified clients helps build a better and more secure Fortnite modding environment. Your digital safety is worth more than any “free” or “OG” experience.

 18. In conclusion, Project Eon is not just a bad mod — it is actively dangerous software designed to steal your Discord account and compromise your computer. Its use of registry tricks, Discord bots, and deceptive icons shows it is malware masquerading as a game client. Removing it requires careful registry edits, file cleanup, and account security measures. Warn your friends and community, stay vigilant, and never risk your accounts for nostalgia. Protect yourself and others by avoiding Project Eon at all costs.
